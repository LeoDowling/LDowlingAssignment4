            <p class=longText>You choose to steal the car. You grab the keys and sprint out the door. You hop in the car and turn the key. It works! Relief washes over you as this ordeal is over. Just then flashing lights appear in your rear view mirror. You are pulled over by the police for grand theft auto. You try to tell your story, but they don't believe it. Maybe next time you'll think twice about stealing someone's car.
