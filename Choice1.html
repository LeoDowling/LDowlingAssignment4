            <p class=longText>You are driving alone down a rural backroad. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but tonight is a particularly foggy night.  All of a sudden you car breaks down and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere. You try your cell phone, but quickly realize you have no service. You assess your options; there is a payphone to your left side, and a path through the forest on your right. Which will you choose?
